                        Title="Trip.com Group at World Economic Forum 2024: Revealing Asia’s biggest untapped opportunities in tourism",
                        Content="<p>Leading global travel service provider Trip.com Group is embracing new trends and opportunities in the post-pandemic travel landscape, with its CEO Jane Sun sharing insights at the prominent World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting held in Davos, Switzerland, this week. Ms Sun also expressed optimism about Asia’s continued growth and shared her perspective on its investment potential at the panel discussion titled “Asia – the world’s next growth anchor?”</p><p>As major leaders from government, business, and civil society gathered to discuss the fundamental principles of driving trust in a world of fractures and uncertainties, the panel convened influential stakeholders to delve into the exciting opportunities and new challenges emerging in Asia. Speaking alongside Ms Sun were Mr Roy Gori, President and CEO of Canada’s largest insurance company Manulife, and Mr Geoff Lee, Executive Director, Head of Private Markets and Head of Technology at Malaysia’s sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional. Mr Ben Hung, CEO, Asia, at Standard Chartered Bank, moderated the panel.</p><p>With global tourism approaching a full recovery, Trip.com Group has witnessed strong booking interest in Asia, with Thailand, Japan, and South Korea among the top travel destinations. The rise in consumer income has also led to growing trends in the region such as high-quality wellness experiences and event tourism, particularly for sought-after events like concerts and music festivals.</p><p>Sustainable tourism is another shift that is picking up steam, with environmental awareness motivating more than 16 million Trip.com Group customers to choose low-carbon travel options, such as hotels that adhere to sustainable standards. The Group has also prioritised options such as the rental of electronic vehicles and offering flights with lower carbon emissions.</p><p>Zooming in on the post-pandemic economic trajectory in one of Asia’s largest regions, Ms Sun asserted that China offers more investment opportunities than what some may have perceived.</p><p>“Investors should not overlook the thriving travel, wellness or entertainment sector in China. With its vast size, diverse industries, and varying levels of consumer buying power, the investment opportunities are abundant,” said Ms Sun. In particular, the travel sector presents numerous untapped growth opportunities, such as the rapid increase in inbound and outbound travel, as well as favourable policy developments.</p><p>Ms Sun expressed optimism about the growth of the tourism industry, especially with recent positive developments, such as increased flight capacities and expanded visa-free arrangements, that have facilitated international travel to and from China. These include the recent unilateral visa-free policies for several countries, including France, Germany, Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands, mutual visa-free agreements with Malaysia, and plans for similar arrangements with Singapore and Thailand. China also announced earlier in the week that it will unilaterally grant visa-free entry to Swiss and Irish nationals. Since July 2023, China has removed visa requirements for citizens of 11 nations.</p><p>According to Trip.com Group data, significant increases have been recorded in inbound search and booking volumes from countries such as Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands. Those with visa-free arrangements or plans for relaxed visa policies, such as Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia, are among the top destinations favoured by Chinese tourists for the upcoming Chinese New Year.</p><p>Moreover, since its launch in September 2023, Trip.com’s “China Travel Guide”, which provides information about hotel, transport, payment, and other travel-related issues, has served nearly 100,000 international travellers planning to visit China. Meanwhile, as of mid-January, outbound travel orders for the upcoming Chinese New Year holidays have surged more than 10 times compared to the previous year.</p><p>For the wider Asian economy, Ms Sun maintained that its prospects remain robust, citing projections that it will contribute to around 50% of global GDP growth. The rapid development of the tourism industry in Asia, coupled with the strong purchasing power of Asian customers, has indicated the potential for sustained growth in the region.</p><p>“We are committed to forging an influential network for our global partners, empowering them to welcome customers from every corner of the world,” said Ms Sun. “Equally, we stand poised to usher Asian customers into the global arena, opening doors to boundless opportunities and creating pathways for unprecedented international success.”</p>",

                        Title="Trip.com Group CEO tackles overtourism for sustainable travel at World Economic Forum",
                        Content="<p>Trip.com Group, a leading global travel service provider, has set its sights on tackling key challenges surrounding the tourism industry. This is evidenced by CEO Ms Jane Sun's participation in the panel discussion \"Sorry, We're Full: Tackling Overtourism\" at the prestigious World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The forum invited influential dignitaries, from political elites to business leaders, to tackle the challenges facing our world, in the hope of finding common ground and united solutions, aligning with this year's theme of \"Rebuilding Trust\".</p><p>Davos comes as the world looks forward to forging a new normal for sustainable travel in the post-pandemic era. Over 75% of respondents in Trip.com Group’s sustainability report agreed that sustainable travel is vital. However, the industry faces obstacles to sustainable travel, particularly as the rise in visitor numbers approaches pre-pandemic levels. Consequently, destinations contend with multiple challenges, such as preserving heritage sites, combating pollution, and looking after their ecosystems.</p><p>At the forum, Ms Sun shared her views on the challenges of overtourism for multiple stakeholders across the industry. Ms Sun spoke alongside a distinguished panel of guests, including Ms Sithembile Ntombela, Acting Chief Executive Officer of Brand South Africa; Mr Stephen Cotton, General Secretary of the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF); and Mr Tony Fernandes, Chief Executive Officer of Capital A Berhad (AirAsia). The forum was moderated by CNN International’s anchor and correspondent Richard Quest.</p><p><br><i>From left to right: Mr Richard Quest, CNN International’s anchor and correspondent; Ms Jane Sun, CEO of Trip.com Group; Ms Sithembile Ntombela, Acting Chief Executive Officer of Brand South Africa; Mr Tony Fernandes, Chief Executive Officer of Capital A Berhad (AirAsia); and Mr Stephen Cotton, General Secretary of the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF). Source: World Economic Forum</i></p><p>Ms Sun also met with government officials from various countries to build upon the success of the region's travel growth momentum.</p><p>Tackling overtourism can only work if sustainability is embedded across the travel and tourism industry. Trip.com Group addresses this challenge through a multifaceted approach, with initiatives to promote sustainable travel practices, improve infrastructure, and combat the environmental and social implications.</p><p>\"We need to approach the issue of overtourism with a balanced view. Destinations can become overcrowded without proper management, and the overall experience suffers. It's imperative to find ways for supply and demand to grow sustainably,\" said Ms Sun.</p><p>Investing in high-quality tourism is a viable approach to attract visitors to less well-travelled destinations. Several key markets, such as Thailand and Malaysia, have endorsed the idea of attracting \"high-value\" tourists to redirect demand away from hotspots. Simultaneously, other regions aim to diversify tourist influx by offering niche forms of tourism unique to under-visited regions. This mitigates overtourism and holds the potential for economic gains, with destinations such as Dubai successfully expanding their wellness tourism industry to an estimated value exceeding USD 108 billion.</p><p>To alleviate pressure on popular destinations, another strategy involves the promotion of lesser-known destinations, known as long-tail tourism. Advancements in technology and social networking have made marketing approaches that focus on lesser-known locales more effective. For instance, Trip.com Group employs content marketing strategies, including e-commerce campaigns and leveraging its social travel platform, Trip Moments, to showcase less visited areas. Daegu – a lesser-known destination in Korea – was highlighted in a successful digital campaign which garnered over 29 million views, resulting in an 87% increase in product sales compared to the same period in the previous year.</p><p>Beyond promoting lesser-known destinations, targeting lull periods or traditionally low travel seasons can help to address overtourism during peak travel periods. To make this possible, Trip.com Group provides advanced and flexible booking options to ensure customers have the freedom to adapt their travel plans whenever necessary.</p><p>The Group is also keen to collaborate with partners and industry stakeholders to find sustainable solutions over the long run.</p><p>“The complex challenges of overtourism demand more than quick fixes – it will not be resolved overnight. However, through unwavering dedication from multiple stakeholders, we believe that every effort contributes to shaping a future where travel harmonises seamlessly with sustainable principles. This goes beyond a goal; it’s a powerful commitment to redefine the very essence of responsible travel,” stated Ms Sun.</p>\t2024-01-22T16:49:06.039\tmoqxtq0n.pjwnew2.jpg\t\r\n11\tTrip.com Group and Vietjet Air Sign MOU to Improve Global Travellers’ Experience\t<p>Leading global travel service provider Trip.com Group has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Vietjet Air to leverage the expertise and resources of both parties to make travel easier and more convenient for travellers around the world.</p><p>This will be achieved through various initiatives, such as offering Trip.com Group’s products – including hotels, airport transfers, attractions and activities – to customers on Vietjet’s website.

                        Content="<p>A delegation led by Malaysia’s Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture, Dato' Sri Tiong King Sing, was hosted at leading global travel service provider Trip.com Group’s headquarters in Shanghai by the Group’s Chief Executive Officer Ms Jane Sun and other senior executives. Following a productive meeting where both parties engaged in in-depth discussions about the development of Malaysia’s tourism industry, the Group and the Ministry of Tourism, Arts, and Culture (MOTAC) signed a strategic partnership to promote Malaysia as a destination of choice for the Chinese outbound market.</p><p>The partnership was signed by Mr Edison Chen, Vice President of Destination Marketing &amp; Strategic Alliances, Trip.com Group, and Dato' Yeoh Soon Hin, Deputy Chairman of Tourism Malaysia, and witnessed by Ms Sun and Dato’ Sri Tiong. It solidifies a close partnership that has been maintained for many years.</p><p>Malaysia is actively building towards “Visit Malaysia Year 2026”, with target of 26.1 million international tourist arrivals and MYR97.6 billion in tourist expenditure. To this end, both parties will collaborate extensively to promote Malaysia as a tourism destination, utilising online and offline resources to craft customised outbound marketing campaigns, provide high-quality travel services to Chinese tourists, enhance user travel experiences, and actively promote the full recovery of Malaysia's tourism industry.</p><p>Said Ms Jane Sun, Chief Executive Officer, Trip.com Group: “Malaysia enjoys an abundance of tourist attractions – I have been there many times myself, and have been deeply impressed by the unique characteristics of each destination. With the recent introduction of mutual visa-free entry for visitors from China and Malaysia, the rejuvenation of tourism offerings and the upgrading of destination experiences, more tourists will turn their attention to Malaysia. Trip.com Group will help Malaysian tourism seize this opportunity to achieve full recovery and grow further.”</p><p>Expressing confidence in the collaboration, Dato' Sri Tiong King Sing, Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture, Malaysia, said: “I am honoured to witness the signing of this strategic partnership, and I hope that both sides will be able to quickly start deploying the plans in order to fully implement the partnership in the near future. With Trip.com Group’s strength and years of experience, I have no doubt that Malaysia will become the preferred destination for more Chinese travellers next year.”</p><p>To celebrate the partnership, Tourism Malaysia will appear on this evening’s Boss Live broadcast at 7.00pm to host the first-ever Malaysia-themed live event on the Trip.com’s Ctrip app, offering exclusive discounts and a wide range of travel products to users across the platform.</p><p>Following the introduction of the mutual visa exemption policy between China and Malaysia on 26 November 2023, Trip.com Group’s data showed that Malaysia-related searches increased by 96% compared to the previous week. With favourable policies from both countries and deepening cooperation, this collaboration is poised to seize the opportunity for extensive growth in bilateral tourism and cultural exchanges.</p><p>In 2022, Malaysia’s tourism industry contributed MYR251.5 billion to Malaysia’s gross domestic product (GDP). This constituted 14% of its GDP, making tourism the country’s third largest contributor. It also contributed 23.4% to Malaysia’s total workforce, with 3.61 million people employed in 2022.</p>",
